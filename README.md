## Statsig React Native SDK

The Statsig SDK for React Native (non Expo) applications. Note that if you're using Expo, use [https://github.com/statsig-io/react-native-expo](https://github.com/statsig-io/react-native-expo) instead.

Statsig helps you move faster with Feature Gates (Feature Flags) and Dynamic Configs. It also allows you to run A/B tests to validate your new features and understand their impact on your KPIs. If you're new to Statsig, create an account at [statsig.com](https://www.statsig.com).
